# LinkedIn AI Reply Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that runs on LinkedIn and assists users in generating replies to messages.

## Languages

This extension is built using Plasmo, React, TypeScript, CSS, and Tailwind CSS.

## How it works

The Chrome extension performs the following tasks:

1. Shows the AI icon when the user focuses on the LinkedIn message input field. The icon disappears when the input field is no longer focused.
2. Displays a center-aligned modal when clicking on the icon. Clicking anywhere outside this modal closes it.
3. Allows the user to enter any command in the modal's input field.
4. Displays a response when the “Generate” button is clicked. The “Regenerate” button is non-functional.
5. Inserts the generated text into the message input field when the user clicks on the insert button.

## Demo

Here is a brief video demonstrating all tasks as mentioned:
